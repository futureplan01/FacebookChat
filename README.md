# FacebookChat

The Facebook Chat creates a Server. 
When Clients log into the server, the sever will send infomation about the rest of the clients that are logged on
Create a Gui, with multiple buttons that will allow people to click on the buttons and start chatting with other people.

The Chat is incomplete however, Does not update clients when the server is logged into.
